#### **What is RIP?**  
Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is one of the oldest **distance-vector** routing protocols used in networks. It enables routers to exchange routing information to determine the best path for data packets. RIP uses **hop count** as a metric to measure the distance between source and destination, with a maximum hop limit of **15** (anything beyond 15 is considered unreachable).  

#### **Why Was RIP Created?**  
In the early days of networking, there was a need for a simple, standardized way for routers to communicate and share routing information. RIP was designed in the **1980s** to provide:  
- **Automated Routing** – Routers could dynamically update their tables instead of manual configuration.  
- **Simplicity** – Easy to implement with minimal processing power.  
- **Compatibility** – Worked across different vendors' network devices.  

#### **How Does RIP Work?**  
- Each router **broadcasts its routing table** to its neighbors every **30 seconds**.  
- Routers update their tables based on received information, choosing the shortest path (fewer hops).  
- If a route is unreachable for **180 seconds**, it is removed (RIP uses a timeout mechanism).  
- Uses **split horizon** and **hold-down timers** to reduce routing loops and ensure stability.  

#### **Versions of RIP**  
- **RIP v1** – Classful, does not support subnet masks (obsolete).  
- **RIP v2** – Classless, supports CIDR (still in use).  
- **RIPng** – An extension of RIP for IPv6 networks.  

#### **Applications of RIP**  
- **Small networks** – Due to its hop limit, RIP is best suited for small to medium-sized networks.  
- **Legacy systems** – Older hardware that cannot support more advanced protocols like OSPF or BGP.  
- **Educational purposes** – Used for learning about routing basics in networking courses.  

#### **Limitations of RIP**  
- **Slow convergence** – Takes time to recover from network changes.  
- **Scalability issues** – Not suitable for large networks due to the 15-hop limit.  
- **Inefficient routing** – Does not consider factors like bandwidth or latency, only hop count.  

#### **Why is RIP Still Relevant?**  
Despite its limitations, RIP is still used in certain environments where simplicity and compatibility matter more than efficiency. However, modern networks often prefer more advanced protocols like OSPF or EIGRP for better performance.
